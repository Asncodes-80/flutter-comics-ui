# Flutter Comical UI Design Documentation

We build Researchable and Incredible things, that you can use, contribute, improve yourself, and all things that you can
enjoy by that. *The Comics UI Kit*, Design System, is a one of the most beautiful and nostalgic design that you can find.

## Use cases

Use `Comics UI Kit` every where. But most usage of that is in `Web3`, `GameFi` Apps and others. For more info about the
`GameFi` application, that can be ether a game or an Application that you can earn money or any valuable things from that.
`GameFi` is not same as `Gamification`. `GameFi` is base on Game + Finance. Gamification apps can be any things but is not
necessary come with money or finance. Like `Duolingo` app.


## Palette, Colors and Typography

All this section will divide to two topic, **Action-Type** and **Overall-Type**. For example we have two colors. one about
action colors and other about overall color. Action color is special form of color and it is two or three combination of colors.
We have triple color palette per Action colors. In overall topic, we only have normal form of objects, Typos, Colors and etc...


At this project we use two locales, **English** and **Persian**. At English we use two main font family, `Integral-CF` and `Poppins`. `Integral-CF` with all their types as **Action-Topic**, we made it for headlines, some ink titles. `Poppins` as `Overall-Type` will use to demonstrate bodies, some nonsignificant titles, labels and etc.

We create a super simple widget in `/lib/widgets/comic_text.dart`. Contains three text layer inside of a `Stack`. The first Text is main Shadow of the text, Second text is Stroke of the text and at the last text is main text.

Base on [Colourlovers](https://colourlovers.com), The Comic book characters are traditionally colorful, but those who pay special attention will note that it's not all random palettes. In fact, there's a science to How colors are used in your favorite comic, and while it may seem like a small thing, the inks used **Drastically** Affect your experience as *reader*.

Heroes vs villains the most traditional color scheme is Black vs White, with the darker colors usually symbolizing evil. However, over time, this has evolved to include more colors, and some comic artists actually play on our expectations to turn villains into unlikely heroes.

_Note:_ This is only simple guide for developers to develop their typography with this method!
